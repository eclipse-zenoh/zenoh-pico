    "description": "The Eclipse Zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute. It unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks. Zenoh-Pico is the implementation able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks.",
