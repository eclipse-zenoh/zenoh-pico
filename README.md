# Eclipse Zenoh
The Eclipse Zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute.

Zenoh (pronounce _/zeno/_) unifies data in motion, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

Check the website [zenoh.io](http://zenoh.io) and the [roadmap](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap) for more detailed information.

# Zenoh-Pico: native C library for constrained devices

zenoh-pico is the [Eclipse zenoh](http://zenoh.io) implementation that targets constrained devices and offers a native C API.
It is fully compatible with its main [Rust Zenoh implementation](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh), providing a lightweight implementation of most functionalities.

Currently, zenoh-pico provides support for the following (RT)OSs and protocols:

|  **(RT)OS** |        **Transport Layer**       |  **Network Layer**  |             **Data Link Layer**            |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
|   **Unix**  | UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP | IPv4, IPv6, 6LoWPAN |           WiFi, Ethernet, Thread           |
|  **Zephyr** | UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP | IPv4, IPv6, 6LoWPAN |           WiFi, Ethernet, Thread           |
| **Arduino** | UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP |      IPv4, IPv6     | WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth (Serial profile) |
| **ESP-IDF** | UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP |      IPv4, IPv6     |               WiFi, Ethernet               |
|  **MbedOS** | UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP |      IPv4, IPv6     |           WiFi, Ethernet, Serial           |
|  **OpenCR** | UDP (unicast and multicast), TCP |         IPv4        |                    WiFi                    |

## 1. How to install it

The Eclipse zenoh-pico library is available as **Debian**, **RPM**, and **tgz** packages in the [Eclipse zenoh-pico download area](https://download.eclipse.org/zenoh/zenoh-pico/).
Those packages are built using manylinux2010 x86-32 and x86-64 to be compatible with most of the Linux platforms.
There are 2 kind of packages:

- **libzenohpico**: only contains the library file (.so)
- **libzenohpico-dev**: contains the zenoh-pico header files for development. Depends on *libzenohpico* package

For other platforms - like RTOS for embedded systems / microcontrollers -, you will need to clone and build the sources. Check [below](#how-to-build-for-microcontrollers) for more details.

WARNING: Note that zenoh-pico has not been ported on Windows yet!

-------------------------------
## 2. How to build it

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning: : Zenoh and its ecosystem are under active development. When you build from git, make sure you also build from git any other Zenoh repository you plan to use (e.g. binding, plugin, backend, etc.). It may happen that some changes in git are not compatible with the most recent packaged Zenoh release (e.g. deb, docker, pip). We put particular effort in mantaining compatibility between the various git repositories in the Zenoh project.

### 2.1 Unix Environments
To build the **zenoh-pico** library, you need to ensure that [cmake](https://cmake.org) is available
on your platform -- if not please install it.

Once the [cmake](https://cmake.org) dependency is satisfied, just do the following for **CMake** version 3 and higher:

  -- CMake version 3 and higher --

  ```bash
  $ cd /path/to/zenoh-pico
  $ make
  $ make install # on Linux use **sudo**
  ```

If you want to build with debug symbols, set the `BUILD_TYPE=Debug`environment variable before to run make:
  ```bash
  $ cd /path/to/zenoh-pico
  $ BUILD_TYPE=Debug make
  $ make install # on Linux use **sudo**
  ```

For those that still have **CMake** version 2.8, do the following commands:

  ```bash
  $ cd /path/to/zenoh-pico
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../cmake-2.8
  $ make
  $ make install # on Linux use **sudo**
  ```

### 2.2. Real Time Operating System (RTOS) for Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers

In order to manage and ease the process of building and deploying into a a variety of platforms and frameworks
for embedded systems and microcontrollers, [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) can be
used as a supporting platform.

Once the PlatformIO dependency is satisfied, follow the steps below for the
tested micro controllers.

#### 2.2.1. Zephyr
Note: tested with reel_board, nucleo-f767zi, nucleo-f420zi, and nRF52840 boards.

A typical PlatformIO project for Zephyr framework must have the following
structure:

  ```bash
  project_dir

  ├── src
  │    └── main.c
  ├── zephyr
  │    ├── prj.conf
  │    └── CMakeLists.txt
  └── platformio.ini
  ```

To initialize this project structure, execute the following commands:

  ```bash
  $ mkdir -p /path/to/project_dir
  $ cd /path/to/project_dir
  $ platformio init -b reel_board
  $ platformio run
  ```

Include the CMakelist.txt and prj.conf in the project_dir/zephyr folder as
shown in the structure above,

  ```bash
  $ cp /path/to/zenoh-pico/docs/zephyr/reel_board/CMakelists.txt /path/to/project_dir/zephyr/
  $ cp /path/to/zenoh-pico/docs/zephyr/reel_board/prj.conf /path/to/project_dir/zephyr/
  ```

and add zenoh-pico as a library by doing:

  ```bash
  $ ln -s /path/to/zenoh-pico /path/to/project_dir/lib/zenoh-pico
  ```
or just include the following line in platformio.ini:

  ```

## 3. Running the Examples
The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the **zenoh** network router (see [http://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/quick-test/](http://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/quick-test/)) and then to run the examples on your machine.

### 3.1. Starting the zenoh Network Service
Assuming you've pulled the Docker image of the **zenoh** network router on a Linux host (to leverage UDP multicast scouting has explained [here](https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/quick-test/#run-zenoh-router-in-a-docker-container), then simply do:

```bash
$ docker run --init --net host eclipse/zenoh:master
```

To see the zenoh manual page, simply do:

```bash
$ docker run --init --net host eclipse/zenoh:master --help
```

### 3.2. Basic Pub/Sub Example
Assuming that (1) you are running the **zenoh** network router,  and (2) you are under the build directory, do:
```bash
$ ./z_sub
```

And on another shell, do:
```bash
$ ./z_pub
```
### 3.3. Basic Queryable/Get Example
Assuming you are running the **zenoh** network router, do:
```bash
$ ./z_queryable
```

And on another shell, do:
```bash
$ ./z_get
```
